3. HOW TO PLAY
----------------------------------------------------------------

The object of Swarm Racer is to collect all of the gems in each track as
fast as possible. This requires a bit of planning, a bit of luck, and a
lot of swarm controlling finesse. 

KEYS

Cursors: Move
Z: Spread Out
X: Regroup
R: Restart

If you have trouble with key locking, you can mix and match with this
alternative set of key:

ASDW: Move
CTRL: Spread Out
ALT: Regroup

TIPS

The key to getting fast times is learning how to control your swarm
effectively. Here are some tips:

1. No bee left behind. Sometimes it is worth ditching the odd stray bee,
but in general try to keep your swarm together with the regroup key (X)
whenever it starts getting messy.

2. Spread out to collect large areas of gems. If you keep your finger
down on Z, your swarm will eventually move into a large circle which
makes it easier to sweep through a lot of gems at once.

3. Use the walls. To get your swarm into a really tight pack, try
running up against the side of a wall or into a corner.

4. Watch movies. Study how other people handle their swarms by visiting
the BBS: http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs


WALL TYPES

	RED: Blinky
	These walls blink on and off in a regular fashion, so you can predict 
	the pattern with a bit of examination.

	GREEN: Bouncey
	Try holding down the regroup key to avoid having your swarm separated 
	from bouncing all over the place.	

	YELLOW: Sticky
	Not really a wall - your bees can move through this, but very
	slowly. In general it's best to just avoid them.	


TROPHIES

If you get a fast time, you win a trophy. The times required for each
trophy are shown at the start of each race, and your best trophy for
each track is shown on the race menu screen. Try to collect all 8 gold
trophies. Go on. Bet you can't.
